# Visualizing concepts from EE364A (Convex Optimization) using Marimo
Here, you can find some interactive demos for HW problems as well as some additional demos aiming to show relations between primal/dual problems and provide intuition. Feel free to email requests/ideas for new demos to nzahedi@stanford.edu.

## HW4
Coming soon 


## HW5
Coming soon
